# studentalbum
This is a simple student album for anyone starting to learn bootstrap 4 and php

Note:
The Student Album Application is not a fully working Album, I left the edit part of the album for you to work out. If you want to edit the JS, edit main.js only and run gulp task. Do not touch other js because they are just dependencies.

Browser-Sync is omitted because this is more of a php application.

After Setting up Wamp Server or MAMP

1. Set your document root directory to Public in httpd.conf
2. Open phpmyadmin and create a new DB called studentdb
3. import studentdb.sql
4. Open App/Config.php edit to suit your db configuration
